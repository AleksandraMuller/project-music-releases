# 'New Releases' music site built using React ðŸŽ¼ ðŸŽµ

In this project I use React components to build a page which shows new album and single releases.
Data I use is an API response from Spotify which contains data for 50 recent releases.

## In this project, you will find:

- React components
- Method .map to iterate over an array of data and mount many components
- React props to feed information to components

## Tools/ techniques, approach and planning ðŸ”¨

I used functional React to build this project. The project is divided into multiple Components. If I had more time, I would render a list of playlists in a sidebar. I would also re-arrange some of the Components and try to make my code cleaner.

## Deployed version ðŸš€
